# Overview

I'm a PhD candidate in the laboratory of [Professor Michelle O'Malley](https://omalleylab.com/) at the [University of California, Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/).  I'm passionate about using the technology that nature itself has developed and honed over billions of years to make the world a better place, particularly through the study and engineering of microbes and microbial communities.

A list of my publications can be found [here](publications.md).

# Research

As a researcher in the O'Malley lab, I employ both experimental and computational approaches to study two lines of research, unified by the common theme of understanding how the interactions between microbes in fiber-digesting anaerobic microbiomes drive community composition and metabolic activity, and employing this knowledge to develop a framework for synthetic consortia that compartmentalize biomass degradation and value-added production of desired microbial metabolites.
